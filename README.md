# Scaling of Feedback Control

## Description
This repository contains the codes required to simulate the results from a research study on the scaling of perturbation response times across the size range of terrestrial mammals [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.614404v1). We used computational models to simulate fast perturbation responses under feedback (PD) control and feedforward (bang-bang) control. We studied how control is affected by two limitations: muscle force capacity limits and sensorimotor time delays. We simulated two perturbation response scenarios: a swing leg repositing task after a trip (Swing task), and a posture recovery after a push (Posture task). We developed two types of models: scaled models that are parametrized with inertial, muscular and neural features to represent the size range of terrestrial mammals, and a normalized feedback control model to generate general predictions.

The codes are distributed across the following folders:
- Swing Task-Scaled
- Swing Task-Norm
- Posture Task-Scaled
- Posture Task-Norm


## Instructions


**Swing Task-Scaled:** 
- **Master_SwingTask_Scaled**: This script loads the probability distributions for the input parameters, sets the number of simulations and perturbation size vector, and saves the final results. 
    - Set opt=0/1 to run or not run optimization
    - Set graph=1/0 to switch graphs on or off. 
- **ddeSwingTask_Scaled**: This function accepts initial guesses for controller gains, optimizes controller gains, and outputs simulation results for a single mass.
- **Data_Swng task**: Dataset with results for all masses

**Posture Task-Scaled**
- **Master_PostureTask_Scaled**:
