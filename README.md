# Scaling of Feedback Control

## Description
This repository contains the codes required to simulate the results from a research study on the scaling of perturbation response times across the size range of terrestrial mammals [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.614404v1). We used computational models to simulate fast perturbation responses under feedback (PD) control and feedforward (bang-bang) control. We studied how control is affected by two limitations: muscle force capacity limits and sensorimotor time delays. We simulated two perturbation response scenarios: a swing leg repositing task after a trip (Swing task), and a posture recovery after a push (Posture task). We developed two types of models: scaled models that are parametrized with inertial, muscular and neural features to represent the size range of terrestrial mammals, and a normalized feedback control model to generate general predictions.

## Instructions

### **Swing Task-Scaled-Feedback:** 
- **Master_SwingTask_Scaled**: Script to pass initial guess for controller gains to ddeSwingTask_Scaled.m, collect optimized results, perform linear fit, and graph results. 
    - Set opt=0/1 to run initial guess/run optimization
    - Set graph=0/1 to switch graphs off or on
- **ddeSwingTask_Scaled**: This function accepts initial guesses for controller gains, optimizes controller gains, and outputs simulation results for a single mass.
- **Data_SwingTask**: Dataset with results for all masses

### **Posture Task-Scaled-Feedback**
- **Master_PostureTask_Scaled**: Script to pass initial guess for controller gains to ddePostureTask_Scaled.m, collect optimized results, perform linear fit, and graph results.  
    - Set opt=0/1 to run initial guess/run optimization
    - Set graph=0/1 to switch graphs off or on
- **ddePostureTask_Scaled**: This function accepts initial guesses for controller gains, optimizes controller gains, and outputs simulation results for a single mass.
- **Data_PostureTask**: Dataset with results for all masses
